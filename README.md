# ðŸ§¬ SmallSeqFlow Overview
Small-sample RNA sequencing experiments present unique analytical challenges yet remain common in many research settings due to cost constraints, limited biological material, or rare experimental conditions. While several established RNA-seq analysis pipelines exist, many are optimized for larger datasets or require significant computational infrastructure. To address this gap, I developed a streamlined, Python-based RNA-seq analysis pipeline specifically optimized for small-sample studies that can be easily executed in Jupyter or Google Colab notebooks.

This pipeline integrates essential RNA-seq analysis steps into a series of modular functions, starting from initial data acquisition through to differential expression analysis and visualization. The workflow begins with a robust data loading function that handles compressed files from common repositories, followed by automated conversion of Ensembl IDs to gene symbols using the MyGene.info service - a crucial step for biological interpretation that is often challenging in public datasets. The pipeline then implements a comprehensive quality control visualization suite that helps researchers identify potential technical biases or batch effects before proceeding with analysis.

The core analytical components of the pipeline are carefully chosen to address the statistical challenges of small-sample studies. The filtering and normalization steps use a DESeq2-inspired approach that works well with limited replication, while the differential expression analysis employs Welch's t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction - methods that maintain statistical rigor while acknowledging the limitations of small sample sizes. The final visualization module generates presentation-ready figures that capture both global expression patterns and detailed statistical metrics. The final visualization module generates publication-ready figures that capture both global expression patterns and detailed statistical metrics. Following the initial differential expression analysis, the pipeline enables seamless integration with downstream analyses including weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules, mapping of differentially expressed genes to protein-protein interaction networks, and comprehensive functional enrichment analyses to reveal biological pathways and processes. By packaging these components into a user-friendly notebook format, this pipeline makes robust RNA-seq analysis accessible to researchers working with limited samples, without requiring extensive computational resources or bioinformatics expertise.
